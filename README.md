NUFORC Sightings Reports in 2015

This repository contains the data used to create the maps in my blog post "Mapping UFO Sightings in 2015 with CartoDB." (http://wesmapping.com/blog/mapping-ufo-sightings-in-2015)

This data was pulled from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database, which can be found at http://www.nuforc.org

This data is freely available to the public. Any usage should include attribution to the National UFO Reporting Center. While additional attribution to me and my work would be greatly appreciated, it is not required.
